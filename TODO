=============== [ COLLISION DETECTION ] ===============
1. Move handling
2. Queue struct
3. Detect collide
4. Catch collide and handle it
	* We detect some collides and push it 
	  in queue, then handle FIRST.
	* Then get new queue and handle it again.
    * And when we get empty queue, we continues handle move.
5. We handle 2 collides in same time
