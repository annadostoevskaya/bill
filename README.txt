This is a big project that I started working on about half a year ago and 
I already regretted doing it. Last time, I successfully implemented Tetris and it seemed to me that I would be able to walk at a fairly fast pace along the LazyFoo roadmap. 
I've never been so wrong in my life. The first month I unsuccessfully tried to implement collisions, 
it was because of my complete lack of understanding of what was happening that it took so long.
I've just finished writing a collision with bezier curves (actually it's just a iteration of points on a line, but it doesn't matter), 
and having brought the project to any logical end, I let it go.

I've been a fool. Sorry.

P.S. I'll come back here later to explain what I learned during the project, but it will be in better times.
